## Course Description: 
This course offers an in-depth exploration of the historical development of technology and its disruptive nature. Students will critically analyze significant technological breakthroughs and assess emerging technologies to determine their potential impact. Emphasis is placed on developing skills necessary to prioritize and strategize technological investments in a rapidly evolving landscape.

## Plan:
Using various frameworks and lenses to analysis technology, look for examples past, present, and future of emerging technology related to each of Maslow’s 5 Needs. 

What is an example of a past emerging tech (greater than  25+ years back) that addresses or improves physiological needs? Then a present example ( in the 21st century) and a future example, something we can consider but isn’t yet possible.
