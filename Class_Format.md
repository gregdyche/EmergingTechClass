### Class Format: Analyzing Emerging Technologies**

#### 1. What’s the Emerging Technology in Question?**  

- **Activity**: Briefly introduce the new technology. Use videos, images, or a short reading to spark curiosity.  
- **Prompt for Students**:  
  - PACT: People, Applicaitons, Concepts, Terms
  - Describe the technology. What is it, and how does it work?  
  - What’s exciting or innovative about this technology?  
- **Deliverable**: A concise summary of the new tech’s purpose and potential.

#### **2. What is the Old Technology Being Replaced or Impacted?**  

- **Activity**: Explore the technology or system that is being displaced.  
- **Prompt for Students**:  
  - What was the old technology or method?  
  - How did it work, and who used it?  
- **Deliverable**: A comparison chart or timeline showing how the old system met the need.

#### **3. What is the Need the Old Tech was Satisfying?**  

- **Activity**: Analyze the fundamental human need the old technology addressed (linked to Maslow’s hierarchy).  
- **Prompt for Students**:  
  - What specific problem or challenge did the old technology solve?  
  - How did it fulfill this need for individuals or society?

#### **4. Why Isn’t the Old Tech Good Enough?**  

- **Activity**: Identify the shortcomings or limitations of the old technology.  
- **Prompt for Students**:  
  - What were the key limitations (efficiency, accessibility, cost, safety, scalability, etc.)?  
  - Why was there a need for change or improvement?  
- **Deliverable**: A short presentation or discussion that explains why the old technology was displaced by the new.

### **How This Format Scales to Each Class Topic**  

This structure provides a roadmap for students to engage deeply with each technology, consistently building their analytical skills while uncovering patterns in how technologies evolve. You can expand the exploration with:

- Group work for deeper dives into specific aspects (e.g., technical, societal, economic impacts).
- Reflection or projection: *“What lessons can we apply to today’s emerging technologies?”*

This approach keeps students involved, encourages critical thinking, and aligns with your goal of fostering content creation through discovery.
